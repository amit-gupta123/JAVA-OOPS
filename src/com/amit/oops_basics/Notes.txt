object: Any real world entity which exist physically.
      : Object is actullay the thing which occupy space in memory

Class : A logical construct of any real world entity, obviously object.

Objects have three essential properties:
        1. State of the object: Its values from its datatype.
        2. Identity of the object: Whether one object is different from other/ if they are stored at same memory location.
        3. Behaviour of the object: Behaviour of object is its operation on its data type/predefined function.


Note: Instance variable  : variables inside an object those are declared in class template.
      Reference variable : having reference of memory location/ reference of objects.

      by default a reference variable conatains null value in java.
      all classes in java must be allocated dynamically.

className objectName = new ClassName();
--------------------  -----------------
   compile time         run Time
if an object is created that means class is instantiated.


ClassName(); is an speciall type of function called Consetructor and automatically gets called whenever we create an object
this keyword: used to acces the particular objects's data member inside class in a constructor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
in java primitives are not implemented as object.// stored in stack memory. to make efficiency.
wrapper classes provide a way to create primitive as object.

final keyword means the variable can not be modified.
final variales must be initialised while declared. why? because can't modify it.
final guarantee unmodifiability only if data type is primitive. not reference data type.
Automatic garbage collcetion happens in java
but there is a way provided by java that some action to be performed while changin references.
we can not destroy object, that can be done by garbage collector
but we can perform some action while garbage collector is about to destroy the object.
